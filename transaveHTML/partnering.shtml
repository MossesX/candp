      	<h1>TRANSAVE’S BUSINESS AND PARTNERING STRATEGY</h1>
				<p>Transave’s objective is to be the leader in the development of inhaled, site-specific therapeutics for the treatment of life threatening lung diseases utilizing its proprietary Sustained release Lipid Inhaled Targeting (SLIT™) technology. Since its inception, Transave has concentrated on product development and has succeeded in bringing multiple agents to the clinical development stage.</p>
        <p>Transave's business strategy focuses on products that address severe, life-threatening diseases for which alternative treatments are either unsatisfactory or non-existent. The Company’s potential SLIT™ products may will not only address underserved niche indications (i.e. cystic fibrosis, metastatic osteosarcoma) and but also large markets that which  could benefit from inhaled therapeutics with significantly improved product profiles (i.e. asthma, COPD, PAH).</p>
				<p>Transave attempts to has maximized the probability of successful product development by carefully identifying, selecting and evaluating inhaled SLIT™ therapies based on a strong scientific rationale, sound intellectual property position and significant market potential for a disease indication.</p>

Transave believes that establishing and maintaining selective collaborations with corporate and academic partners can enable it to effectively and economically leverage its resources to develop and market products on a global basis. By creating product candidates with its innovative SLIT™ technology, Transave strives to create valuable later stage product candidates, a robust product pipeline and a strong intellectual property position.</p>
				<p>Our partnering initiatives include technology collaborations that could benefit from our SLIT™ and liposomal formulation expertise, as well as product partnerships that are complementary to our areas of therapeutic focus in respiratory infections, lung cancer and other life threatening diseases.</p>
